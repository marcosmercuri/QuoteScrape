Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?\nRed:Rehabilitated? Well, now let me see. You know, I don't have any idea what that means.\n1967 Parole Hearings Man:Well, it means that you're ready to rejoin society...\nRed:I know what you think it means, sonny. To me, it's just a made up word. A politician's word, so young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie, and have a job. What do you really want to know? Am I sorry for what I did?\n1967 Parole Hearings Man:Well, are you?\nRed:There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try to talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone, and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit.", "Andy Dufresne:[referring to Andy using an alias to launder money for the warden]If they ever try to trace any of those accounts, they're gonna end up chasing a figment of my imagination.\nRed:Well, I'll be damned. Did I say you were good? Shit, you're a Rembrandt!\nAndy Dufresne:Yeah. The funny thing is - on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.", "Red:[narrating]Sometimes it makes me sad, though... Andy being gone. I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up DOES rejoice. But still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.", "Red:[after being denied parole as he expected]Same old shit, different day", "Red:[narrating]I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are best left unsaid. I'd like to think they were singing about something so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it. I tell you, those voices soared higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream. It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away, and for the briefest of moments, every last man in Shawshank felt free.", "Andy Dufresne:What about you? What are you in here for?\nRed:Murder, same as you.\nAndy Dufresne:Innocent?\nRed:[shakes his head]Only guilty man in Shawshank.", "Heywood:The Count of Monte Crisco...\nFloyd:That's \"Cristo\" you dumb shit.\nHeywood:...by Alexandree Dumb-ass.

Hope can drive a man insane.", "[last lines]\nRed:[narrating]I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border.

I hope.", "Red:[referring to the possibility of Andy committing suicide]I don't know; every man has his breaking point.", "Andy Dufresne:That's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you... Haven't you ever felt that way about music?\nRed:I played a mean harmonica as a younger man. Lost interest in it though. Didn't make much sense in here.\nAndy Dufresne:Here's where it makes the most sense. You need it so you don't forget.\nRed:Forget?\nAndy Dufresne:Forget that... there are places in this world that aren't made out of stone. That there's something inside... that they can't get to, that they can't touch. That's yours.\nRed:What're you talking about?\nAndy Dufresne:Hope.", "Andy Dufresne:She was beautiful. God I loved her. I just didn't know how to show it, that's all. I killed her, Red. I didn't pull the trigger, but I drove her away. And that's why she died, because of me.", "Red:These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's institutionalized.\nHeywood:Shit. I could never get like that.\nErnie:Oh yeah? Say that when you been here as long as Brooks has.\nRed:Goddamn right. They send you here for life, and that's exactly what they take. The part that counts, anyway.", "Brooks:Easy peasy japanesey.", "Red:[narrating]We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men. Hell, we could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses. We were the lords of all creation. As for Andy - he spent that break hunkered in the shade, a strange little smile on his face, watching us drink his beer.", "Red:[narrating, referring to the warden committing suicide]I'd like to think that the last thing that went through his head, other than that bullet, was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.", "Andy Dufresne:Red. If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.\nRed:Sure, Andy. Anything.\nAndy Dufresne:There's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?\nRed:Well, there's... there's a lot of hayfields up there.\nAndy Dufresne:One in particular. It's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end. It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It's where I asked my wife to marry me. We went there for a picnic and made love under that oak and I asked and she said yes. Promise me, Red. If you ever get out... find that spot. At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield. Piece of black, volcanic glass. There's something buried under it I want you to have.\nRed:What, Andy? What's buried under there?\nAndy Dufresne:[turns to walk away]You'll have to pry it up... to see.", "Andy Dufresne:[in a letter to Red]Dear Red. If you're reading this, you've gotten out. And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further. You remember the name of the town, don't you?\nRed:Zihuatanejo.\nAndy Dufresne:I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels. I'll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready. Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well. Your friend. Andy.", "Andy Dufresne:You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?\nRed:No.\nAndy Dufresne:They say it has no memory. That's where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place with no memory.", "Boggs:Now, I'm gonna open my fly and you're gonna swallow what I give ya to swallow. And after you swallow mine you're gonna swallow Rooster's cause ya done broke his nose and I think he oughta have something to show for it.\nAndy Dufresne:Anything you put in my mouth you're gonna lose.\nBoggs:Naw, you don't understand. You do that and I'll put all eight inches of steel in your ear.\nAndy Dufresne:All right. But you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to bite down hard. In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong they have to pry the victims jaws open with a crowbar.\nBoggs:Where do you get this shit?\nAndy Dufresne:I read it. You know how to read, you ignorant fuck?", "Red:[narrating]In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank prison. All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes, a bar of soap, and an old rock hammer, damn near worn down to the nub. I remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel through the wall with it. Old Andy did it in less than twenty. Oh, Andy loved geology. I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature. An ice age here, million years of mountain building there. Geology is the study of pressure and time. That's all it takes really, pressure, and time. That, and a big goddamn poster. Like I said, in prison a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied. Turns out Andy's favorite hobby was totin' his wall out into the exercise yard, a handful at a time. I guess after Tommy was killed, Andy decided he'd been here just about long enough. Andy did like he was told, buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine. The guards simply didn't notice. Neither did I... I mean, seriously, how often do you really look at a mans shoes? Andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shit smelling foulness I can't even imagine, or maybe I just don't want to. Five hundred yards... that's the length of five football fields, just shy of half a mile.", "Red:[narrating]Not long after the warden deprived us of his company, I got a postcard in the mail. It was blank, but the postmark said Fort Hancock, Texas. Fort Hancock... right on the border. That's where Andy crossed. When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down, it always makes me laugh. Andy Dufresne... who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side. Andy Dufresne... headed for the Pacific.", "Warden Samuel Norton:[to the new inmates]I believe in two things: discipline and the Bible. Here you'll receive both. Put your trust in the Lord; your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank.", "District Attorney:And that also is very convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?\nAndy Dufresne:Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.", "Warden Samuel Norton:[after Andy escapes]Well?\nRed:Well what?\nWarden Samuel Norton:I see you two all the time, you're thick as thieves, you are. He musta said *something*.\nRed:Honest, Warden, not a word.\nWarden Samuel Norton:[frustrated]Lord, it's a miracle! Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind! Nothing left but some damn rocks on the windowsill. And that cupcake on the wall! Let's ask her, maybe she knows.\nWarden Samuel Norton:[to poster]What say you there, fuzzy-britches? Feel like talking? Aw, guess not. Why should she be any different?\n[hefting one of Andy's rocks]\nWarden Samuel Norton:This is a conspiracy, that's what it is.\n[throwing rocks]\nWarden Samuel Norton:One... big... damn conspiracy! And everyone's in on it, including *her*!\n[Throws a rock at the poster, the rock goes right through it and they hear it clattering. Norton puts his arm through the torn poster and rips it away from the wall, revealing Andy's escape tunnel]", "Red:[narrating]The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you were born, skin burning and half blind from that delousing shit they throw on you, and when they put you in that cell... and those bars slam home... that's when you know it's for real. A whole life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.", "Andy Dufresne:I have no enemies here.\nRed:Yeah? Wait a while. Word gets around. The Sisters have taken quite a likin' to you. Especially Boggs.\nAndy Dufresne:I don't suppose it would help if I told them that I'm not homosexual.\nRed:Neither are they. You have to be human first. They don't qualify.", "Red:[Narrating]I find I'm so excited that I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel. A free man at a start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.", "Andy Dufresne:Bad luck, I guess. It floats around. It's got to land on somebody. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.", "Red:[narrating]There's a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the outside. All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole, so maybe they'd send me back. Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time. Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy.", "Red:[narrating, referring to Andy]I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled, like a man in a park without a care or a worry in the world, like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say... I liked Andy from the start.", "Warden Samuel Norton:[to new inmates, after explaining the prison routine]Any questions?\nPrisoner:When do we eat?\nCaptain Hadley:[Approaches prisoner]You eat when we say you eat. You piss when we say you piss, and you shit when we say you shit. You got that, you maggot dick motherfucker?", "Warden Samuel Norton:[after Andy tells him Tommy could prove Andy's innocence]I have to say that's the most amazing story I've ever heard. What amazes me most is that you were taken in by it.\nAndy Dufresne:[Confused by his response]Sir?\nWarden Samuel Norton:Well, it's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you. He hears your tale of woe and quite naturally, wants to cheer you up. He's young, not terribly bright. It's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.\nAndy Dufresne:Sir, he's telling the truth.\nWarden Samuel Norton:Well, let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist. You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry \"Yes, I did it, I confess! Oh, and by the way, add a life term to my sentence.\"\nAndy Dufresne:You know that wouldn't matter. With Tommy's testimony I can get a new trial.\nWarden Samuel Norton:That's assuming Blatch is still there. Chances are excellent he'd be released by now.\nAndy Dufresne:Well they'd have his last known address, names of relatives. It's a chance, isn't there?\nWarden Samuel Norton:[Shakes his head]\nAndy Dufresne:How can you be so obtuse?\nWarden Samuel Norton:What? What did you call me?\nAndy Dufresne:Obtuse. Is it deliberate?\nWarden Samuel Norton:Son, you're forgetting yourself.\nAndy Dufresne:The country club will have his old time cards. Records, W-2s with his name on them.\nWarden Samuel Norton:If you wanna indulge in this fantasy, that's your business. Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.\nAndy Dufresne:Sir, if I ever get out, I'd never mention what happens here. I'd be just as indictable as you for laundering that money.\nWarden Samuel Norton:[slams his fists on the table]Don't you ever mention money to me again, you sorry son of a bitch. Not in this office, not anywhere.", "Fat Ass:I don't belong here! I want to go home! I want my mother!\nAnother Prisoner:I had your mother, she wasn't that great!", "Warden Samuel Norton:[after Andy escapes]I want him found. Not tomorrow, not after breakfast - now!", "Captain Hadley:Dufresne!\n[to Dekins]\nCaptain Hadley:That's him. That's the one.\nGuard Dekins:I'm Dekins. I was thinking about setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.\nAndy Dufresne:Oh, I see. Well, why don't we have a seat and talk it over. Brooks, do you have a piece of paper and a pencil? Thanks. So, Mr. Dekins...\nBrooks:[at lunchtime to the other prisoners]And then Andy says, \"Mr. Dekins, do you want your sons to go to Harvard... or Yale?\"\nFloyd:He didn't say that!\nBrooks:God is my witness! Dekins just looked at him a second and then he laughed himself silly and afterwards he actually shook Andy's hand.\nHeywood:My ass.\nBrooks:Shook his hand! I near soiled myself, I mean all Andy needed was a suit and a tie and a little jiggly hula gal on his desk and he woulda been *Mister* Dufresne, if you please.\nRed:Making a few friends, huh Andy?\nAndy Dufresne:I wouldn't say friends. I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning - it's a wonderful pet to have.", "Andy Dufresne:[reading letter from Brooks]\"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.

What are you in for?\nAndy Dufresne:Me? My lawyer fucked me. Everybody's innocent in here. Didn't you know that?", "Fat Ass:You don't understand! I'm not supposed to be here!\nInmates:Me neither! They run this place like a fucking prison!", "Warden Samuel Norton:[as he hands Andy's bible back to him]Salvation lies within.", "Red:[narrating]I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him; looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over. That was my first impression of the man.", "Red:You're gonna fit right in. Everyone in here is innocent, you know that? Heywood, what you in here for?\nHeywood:Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.", "Red:[narrating]Two things never happened again after that. The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again... and Boggs never walked again. They transferred him to a minimum security hospital upstate. To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days drinking his food through a straw.", "Red:[narrating]His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes. He never made a sound.", "Tommy Williams:So I'm backing out the door, right, and I got the TV, like this; it was a big old thing, I couldn't see shit; suddenly I hear this voice, \"Police, kid, hands in the air.\" You know, I was standing there, holdin' on to that TV, so finally the voice says, \"You hear what I said, boy?\" And I say, \"Yes sir, I sure did, but if I drop this fucking thing you got me on destruction of property too.\"", "[Warden Norton finds the Bible in his safe after Andy escapes and finds the message Andy left for him]\nAndy Dufresne:Dear Warden, You were right.

Terrible thing. Man that young, less than a year to go, trying to escape... Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him, truly it did.

Nothing... or you will do the hardest time there is. No more protection from the guards. I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton and cast you down with the Sodomites. You'll think you've been fucked by a train! And the library? Gone... sealed off, brick-by-brick. We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard. They'll see the flames for miles. We'll dance around it like wild Injuns! You understand me? Catching my drift?... Or am I being obtuse?\n[beat]\nWarden Samuel Norton:[to Hadley]Give him another month to think about it.", "Red:[referring to Andy]The man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks.", "Red:[Narrating]There must be a con like me in every prison in America. I'm the guy who can get if for you; cigarettes, a bag of reefer, if that's your thing, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation, damn near anything within reason.

Crazy old fool goddamn near cut my throat!\nRed:Aw Heywood, you've had worse from shaving!", "Brooks:[in letter]Dear fellas, I can't believe how fast things move on the outside. I saw an automobile once when I was a kid, but now they're everywhere. The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry. The parole board got me into this halfway house called \"The Brewer\" and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway. It's hard work and I try to keep up, but my hands hurt most of the time. I don't think the store manager likes me very much. Sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds. I keep thinking Jake might just show up and say hello, but he never does. I hope wherever he is, he's doin' okay and makin' new friends. I have trouble sleepin' at night. I have bad dreams like I'm falling. I wake up scared. Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am. Maybe I should get me a gun and rob the Foodway so they'd send me home. I could shoot the manager while I was at it, sort of like a bonus. I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense any more. I don't like it here. I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided not to stay. I doubt they'll kick up any fuss. Not for an old crook like me. P.S: Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat. No hard feelings. Brooks.", "Captain Hadley:What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?", "Red:Ever bother you?\nAndy Dufresne:I don't run the scams Red, I just process the profits. Fine line, maybe, but I also built that library and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diploma.

Money instead of sheets.", "[Andy has asked Red to procure Rita Hayworth]\nAndy Dufresne:Can you get her?\nRed:Take a few weeks.\nAndy Dufresne:Weeks?\nRed:Well yeah, Andy.

I wish I could tell you that - but prison is no fairy-tale world. He never said who did it, but we all knew. Things went on like that for awhile - prison life consists of routine, and then more routine. Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises. The Sisters kept at him - sometimes he was able to fight 'em off, sometimes not. And that's how it went for Andy - that was his routine. I do believe those first two years were the worst for him, and I also believe that if things had gone on that way, this place would have got the best of him.", "[Andy after Warden Norton refuses to appeal his case]\nAndy Dufresne:It's my life.

There is more money potential in narcotics than anything else we're looking at now. If we don't get into it, somebody else will, maybe one of the Five Families, maybe all of them. And with the money they earn they'll be able to buy more police and political power. Then they come after us. Right now we have the unions and we have the gambling and those are the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. If we don't get a piece of that action we risk everything we have.
